# nextcloud-docker
A simple docker-compose stack configuration for a self-hosted Nextcloud instance. 
I used this configuration for years (for my Mark II cloud server), and it served me well, so I decided to share it to the community.
Please note that I do not maintain this configuration as I do not use it anymore because I currently host more than just Nextcloud.

## Setting up
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace values with your own settings. Then, run `setup.sh` to build the containers.

## Updating
See [UPDATING](./UPDATING.md) for details on how to update to a newer Nextcloud version without any issues.
